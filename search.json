    "text": "Hey! I‚Äôm an environmental manager and incoming MSc student passionate about climate change adaptation in urban areas. In Canada, flooding and wildfires present an immense and growing threat to cities. Climate change exacerbated natural disasters are experienced disproportionally across communities, deepening environmental injustices. My work is guided by three big-picture goals:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the biophysical science behind climate change and predicted impacts through applied research üß™\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting science and policy to produce practical, multi-scale, and collaborative management outcomes üåê\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring that climate resiliency initiatives are carried out in a transparent, inclusive, and equitable manner across stakeholders, whilst leveraging existing partnerships üå±\nI strongly believe in systems thinking and addressing climate change from an interdisciplinary perspective. Always looking for new ideas and collaboration opportunities!

Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (‚ÄúOn this page‚Äù).\nIf you‚Äôve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‚Äòtabset‚Äô in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let‚Äôs showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you‚Äôre interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you‚Äôd like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
